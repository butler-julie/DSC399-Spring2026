    "\n",
    "## Part A: Conceptual\n",
    "Answer the following questions in complete sentences. For any resources used outside of the class, including the AI, provide citations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Decribe the main architectural features of the following models:\n",
    "    * ResNet50\n",
    "    * MobileNetV2\n",
    "    * EfficientNetB0\n",
    "    * InceptionV3\n",
    "2. Explain why InceptionV3 requires 299×299 input images, while ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB0 use 224×224.\n",
    "3. What is an auxiliary classifier in InceptionV3? How does it help with training?\n",
    "4. Compare the four models in terms of:\n",
    "    * Number of parameters\n",
    "    * Accuracy on ImageNet (look this up)\n",
    "    * Computational Efficiency\n",
    "    * Typical Use Case\n",
    "5. Explain the advantages of skip connections in ResNet and depthwise separable convolutions in MobileNetV2.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part B: Code\n",
    "Start with the code in the lecture notes and make the following changes. Report the results of each change either in a comment near the relevant code or summarize all of your findings at the end in a few paragraphs. Consider the total performance of the changes (so accuracy and also run time and computational usage). You may choose how many images you train on (the notes use 5,000 as written which is small).\n",
    "* Import the CIFAR-10 data set. Display 16 random images in the original 32x32 configuration and then resize and display 16 random images with 224x224 and 299x299.\n",
    "* Perform the following changes to all four model:\n",
    "    * Change the learning rate of the Adam optimizer to other constants, adpative, or a learning rate scheduler.\n",
    "    * Train the models for more than one epoch.\n",
    "* For ResNet and EfficientNet:\n",
    "    * Try at least one other model from each family. For EfficientNet you will have to go to a larger model. For Resnet you can try a smaller or larger model. Discuss (in a comment or markdown cell) how the new model differs from the old models.\n",
    "* For Inception:\n",
    "    * The loss is computed in the lecture notes as the total loss + 0.4*auxiliary loss. The 0.4 is the standard value but can be changed. Try at least three other values to see how the results change, with at least one value being 1.0 or larger. Why would a value of 1.0 or higher likely reduce the accuracy."
