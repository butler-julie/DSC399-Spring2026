The final project must use machine learning to solve a problem, with some restrictions. If you plan to use an algorithm that was covered either in this course or in DSC 340, then you must apply the algorithm to a type of data which we have not covered (for example applying a recurrent neural network to analyze sound data). If you plan to use a type of data that we have used in this course or in DSC 340, then you must use an algorithm that was not covered in either course. Each student must give a 15 minute presentation on their work during the final exam period for the course. More details of the final project can be found on D2L.\n",
